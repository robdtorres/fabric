Core theme buttons are based on a Bootstrap 4 foundation with MDB additions.

#In General:

- There should only be one **primary** button in any button group.
- "Actions" (i.e. refresh, download, etc.) should be grouped together first, while "preferences" (i.e. shuffle columns, spacing, etc.) are grouped together second or available behind a click.
